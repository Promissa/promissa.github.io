## Info

My name is Peiran Wei and I'm an senior student at ZJU-UIUC majoring in CompE right now.

Currently I'm working with ByteBrain, a research team from Bytedance focused on AI for Infra. We're trying to build up a table parser with high accuracy by combining code parsing with visual recognition. Meanwhile, I'm working with Prof. Yao Lu from NUS CS to develop a dataset of tables from public SEC reports.

## Interest

My research interests lie in AI for infrastructure and optimization. I believe that efficiency is a timeless concern across all industries, and that AI offers a more practical and nuanced perspective on it than pure mathematics alone.

Beside my research life, I have a deep appreciation for video games—not just as entertainment, but as a medium for innovation in storytelling, interaction, and design philosophy. I’m particularly fascinated by games that challenge conventional norm, e.g. Death Stranding, which departs from traditional gameplay to emphasize connection between people in an isolated post-apocalyptic world.
